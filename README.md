- ✅ **Password Encryption**: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt for protection against brute-force attacks.
- ✅ **HTTPS**: Enforced secure connections using HTTPS in production environments.
- ✅ **Google OAuth Integration**: Secure third-party authentication with Google OAuth to enhance user security.
- ✅ **SQL Injection Protection**: Proper use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
